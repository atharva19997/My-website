                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                    <p>At a raw age, I joined Sea Cadet Corps and experienced a disciplined life and when I joined Stallion Motorsport in engineering college, I learned how to be a team player, how to solve problems of varying difficulties and how to go to your limits in all ways and never give up on dreams.
                    From all the experiences in life, I learnt that most important resource in life is TIME, so I got into habit of never wasting time.</p>
                    <p>Hence, I can say that I am hard working and I stop only when the job is done and in an efficient way. I am a quick learner and anything new interests me. As fortunate I was to get good teachers, I want to be the same to others so I strive to clear my concepts and enrich my lifestyle. That is also why I like to keep learning new things and be the Jack of all trades.</p>
                    <p>I aspire to be a technical sound person and be aware of all the new concepts in my field. I want to be financially indipendent as soon as possible and when I have enough for myself, I will start giving it back to the society which ensures my enthusiasm to be a 100% at all stages in life.</p>
